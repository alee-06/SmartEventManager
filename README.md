# Smart Event Manager (CLI-Based)

A Command-Line Interface (CLI) Event Manager built in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and file handling concepts.
This project was developed as part of the ACM Technical Team Recruitment Task.

The system allows users to schedule, manage, and organize events, with support for conflict detection, editing, searching, and admin-only controls. Events are stored persistently in a CSV file for reuse across sessions.
